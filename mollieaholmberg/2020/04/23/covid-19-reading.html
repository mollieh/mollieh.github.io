Vancouver, British Columbia. I’ve deliberately excluded the really scary but also true stuff (there’s plenty of that on

<p>Political scientist Aisha Ahmad’s advice based on her experiences living and 
working in crisis zones around the world:</p>

<h1 id="the-politics-of-covid-19-response">The Politics of COVID-19 Response</h1>
<p>Written by academics who have expertise in the topics they’re writing about, but 
published in blog, essay, or op-ed form for the general public:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anthropologist <strong>Adia Benton</strong>, who has worked on the politics of HIV and Ebola responses, explains 
<a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2020/02/04/Coronavirus-xenophobia-outbreaks-epidemics-social-media">why the language we use to talk about pathogens like COVID-19 impacts how diseases spread and affect different populations</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/coronavirus-immunity-passports.html">this New York Times op-ed,</a> 
historian <strong>Kathryn Olivarius</strong> draws on her research about the history of yellow fever in the antebellum US 
South to explain the dangers of giving people with immunity special privileges during COVID-19.</li>
  <li>A team of epidemiologists and critical geographers led by <strong>Rob Wallace</strong> talk about the connections between 
<a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2020/04/01/covid-19-and-circuits-of-capital/">capitalism, global food systems, and COVID-19</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commentaries in academic journals (apologies for the paywalls):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anthropologist <strong>Susan Erikson</strong> and geographer <strong>Leigh Johnson</strong> talk financial innovation and pandemic response 
in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30150-X/fulltext#%20">this commentary</a> 
for <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em></li>
  <li>Writing into <em>The Lancet</em>, <strong>Sarah Dalgish</strong> from the Johns Hopkins Department of Public Health explains why 
<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30739-X/fulltext#%20">COVID-19 has called conventional metrics of global health expertise into serious question</a>.</li>
