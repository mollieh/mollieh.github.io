I wanted to offer some resources that have been helpful for me processing the COVID-19 outbreak here in 
Vancouver, British Columbia.

# Coping in Academia during COVID-19 
Political scientist Aisha Ahmad's advice based on her experiences living and 
working in crisis zones around the world:

# The Politics of COVID-19 Response
Written by academics who have expertise in the topics they're writing about, but 
published in blog, essay, or op-ed form for the general public:
* Anthropologist **Adia Benton**, who has worked on the politics of HIV and Ebola responses, explains 
[why the language we use to talk about pathogens like COVID-19 impacts how diseases spread and affect different populations](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2020/02/04/Coronavirus-xenophobia-outbreaks-epidemics-social-media).
* In [this New York Times op-ed,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/coronavirus-immunity-passports.html) 
historian **Kathryn Olivarius** draws on her research about the history of yellow fever in the antebellum US 
South to explain the dangers of giving people with immunity special privileges during COVID-19. 
* A team of epidemiologists and critical geographers led by **Rob Wallace** talk about the connections between 
[capitalism, global food systems, and COVID-19]("https://monthlyreview.org/2020/04/01/covid-19-and-circuits-of-capital/").

Commentaries in academic journals (apologies for the paywalls):
* Anthropologist **Susan Erikson** and geographer **Leigh Johnson** talk financial innovation and pandemic response 
in [this commentary](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30150-X/fulltext#%20) 
for *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*
* Writing into *The Lancet*, **Sarah Dalgish** from the Johns Hopkins Department of Public Health explains why 
[COVID-19 has called conventional metrics of global health expertise into serious question](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30739-X/fulltext#%20).
