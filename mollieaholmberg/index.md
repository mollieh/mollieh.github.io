I am an MA student in Geography at the University of British Columbia. After graduating with a biology degree,
 I worked in data science for two and a half years forecasting health outcomes at the Institute for Health Metrics and
  Evaluation. Now, I study how interactions between scientific practices and power impact ecosystems and health
   equity.

At the [Institute for Health Metrics](http://www.healthdata.org) (IHME), I developed databases, diagnostic data visualizations,
 and computational infrastructure to support the first ever cause-specific simulations of mortality and morbidity based on
  [Global Burden of Disease (GBD)](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about) data for all countries through 2040. This work
   eventually became the [Future Health Scenarios](http://www.healthdata.org/future-health-scenarios) project.
   Over time, my work on this project expanded to include modeling future vaccine introductions and rollouts, future
    conflict mortality, and forecasts of rare disease outbreaks like Ebola. During my time at IHME, I also contributed
     to the first and second metric assessments of countries' progress towards the health-related Sustainable
      Development Goals.

For my MA work, I've blended my undergraduate training in biology and love for the critical humanities by using the Giant Pacific
 octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*) exhibit at the Vancouver Aquarium to investigate the role of captive
 care in conservation. Engaging with
   feminist scholarship and conservation science studies, this work outlines how
      captive care (as a conservation strategy) operates in tension with ecological violence it simultaneously opposes
       and relies upon.
