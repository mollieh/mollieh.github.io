At the [Institute for Health Metrics](http://www.healthdata.org) (IHME), I developed databases, diagnostic data visualizations,
 and computational infrastructure to support the first ever cause-specific simulations of mortality and morbidity based on
  [Global Burden of Disease (GBD)](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about) data for all countries through 2040. This work
   eventually became the [Future Health Scenarios](http://www.healthdata.org/future-health-scenarios) project.
   Over time, my work on this project expanded to include modeling future vaccine introductions and rollouts, future
    conflict mortality, and forecasts of rare disease outbreaks like Ebola. During my time at IHME, I also contributed
     to the first and second metric assessments of countries' progress towards the health-related Sustainable
      Development Goals.
