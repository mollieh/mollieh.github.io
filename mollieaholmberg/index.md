I am an MA student in Geography at the University of British Columbia. After graduating with a biology degree, I worked in data science for two and a half years forecasting health outcomes at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Now, I study how interactions between scientific practices and power impact global ecosystems and health equity.
