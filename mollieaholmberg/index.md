I am a PhD student in Geography at the University of British Columbia. After graduating with a biology degree,
 I worked in data science for two and a half years forecasting health outcomes at the Institute for Health Metrics and
  Evaluation. Now, I study how interactions between scientific practices and power impact ecosystems and health
   equity.

For my MA work, I blended my undergraduate training in biology and love for the critical humanities by using the Giant Pacific
 octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*) exhibit at the Vancouver Aquarium to investigate the role of captive
 care in conservation. Engaging with
   feminist scholarship and conservation science studies, this work outlines how
      captive care as a conservation strategy operates in tension with ecological violence it simultaneously opposes
       and relies upon.
