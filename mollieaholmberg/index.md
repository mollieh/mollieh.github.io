I am an MA student in Geography at the University of British Columbia. After graduating with a biology degree,
 I worked in data science for two and a half years forecasting health outcomes at the Institute for Health Metrics and
  Evaluation. Now, I study how interactions between scientific practices and power impact global ecosystems and health
   equity.

My MA work focuses on the Giant Pacific octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*) exhibit at the Vancouver Aquarium,
   investigating how people use this exhibit to implement conservation work. Engaging with
   feminist scholarship and conservation science studies, I argue that the Aquarium seeks to produce
    modes of caring that also enclose octopuses within human control. This control only unravels where human care fails or ends.
    However, failed care often kills. The Aquarium’s life-giving forms of care degrade wild-caught octopus health but
     only unravel without violence when staff deliberately cede control over care outcomes. This work illustrates how
      the Aquarium’s conservation mandate operates in tension with ecological violence it simultaneously opposes and relies upon.

At the [Institute for Health Metrics](http://www.healthdata.org), I developed databases, diagnostic data visualizations,
 and computational infrastructure to support the first ever cause-specific simulations of mortality and morbidity based on
  [Global Burden of Disease (GBD)](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about) data for all countries through 2040. This work
   eventually became the [Future Health Scenarios](http://www.healthdata.org/future-health-scenarios) project.
   Over time, my work on this project expanded to include modeling future vaccine introductions and rollouts, future
    conflict mortality, and forecasts of rare disease outbreaks like Ebola. During my time at IHME, I also contributed
     to the first and second metric assessments of countries' progress towards the health-related Sustainable
      Development Goals (SDGs).
